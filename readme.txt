In order to get working radio communiaction the most important thing is charged battery.
Charge it!
Check if on boost converter is about 10 V, and on the output of buck is about 5 V.
If communication ratio is shitty, change channel.

Radio got its own battery, which improves communication signifacantly. 
After any changes in wiring, check for the common ground.

PID is working worse than modified PI controller. I don't think I can correct it.
