Changelog:

18.11.06
	Radio module is powered directly from 10 V power rail.
	Message length is shortened to 6 bytes
	Receiver skips about 20% of data, but communication is quite stable
	
18.11.07
	Radio module worked like shit before changing channel - need auto channel change: check data loss rate and if its over 20% send message to pilot about changing channel.
	Analog calibration still in progress
	Pretty good data loss rate - almost 0 %
	
19.06.11
	Answer for radio problems is power. 
	In order to get working radio communiaction the most important thing is charged battery.
	Charge it!
	Check if on boost converter is about 10 V, and on the output of buck is about 5 V.

	Radio got its own battery, which improves communication significantly. 
	After any changes in wiring, check for the common ground.

	PID is working worse than modified PI controller. I don't think I can correct it.
	In future I plan to use BMS and 3S Battery with over 11 V. That sould erase all power problems.
